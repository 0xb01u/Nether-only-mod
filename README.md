# Nether Only Mod
Minecraft, But You Can't Leave The Nether...

Inspired by #DreamNetherChallenge, Nether Only Mod makes Minecraft one Hell of a experience (haha). Changes include:
 - Players spawn and respawn in the Nether.
 - Nether portals can't be lit.
 - Nether Strongholds may be generated in any Nether biome.

Can YOU beat Minecraft without leaving the Nether?

### Note
Some seeds may be impossible to play due to bad spawning.

## TODO
Nether Only Mod, although playable and beatable, is still Work in Progress. Here's a list of future planned features/known issues.
 - Make a Nether-End dimension.
 - Generate Nether-Strongholds similarly to regular Strongholds (using a predictable formula).
 - Fix Nether-Stronghold structure when generated on lava lakes.
 - Give the "Eye Spy" advancement when the player enters a Nether-Stronghold.
